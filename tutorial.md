## TUTORIAL: First interaction

This tutorial illustrates how to work with the VENUE platform.

First, it is required to download the [Virtual Machine](www.google.es) (VM) containing the VENUE installation. The VM runs an Ubuntu server 16.04 LTS that includes 1) [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/) discrete-event network simulator and 2) [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/) system container manager.
