## Virtualized ENvironment for Uav Simulation


_Key words: UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), Network Simulator_

This repository contains the implementation details for the development of a Virtualized Environment for UAV Network simulation. This work is based on [Linux Containers](https://linuxcontainers.org/) and [Ns3](https://www.nsnam.org/), more specifically in [HOWTO Use Linux Containers to set up virtual networks](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/HOWTO_Use_Linux_Containers_to_set_up_virtual_networks)
