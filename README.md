DROne NETwork SIMulator

The purpose of this network simulator emerged from the need to find a product that includes Wireless Sofware Defined Networks (WSDN) and customizable mobility models.  These characteristics allow simulating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) scenarios where SDN is used as a solution to enable communication between network devices.
