## Virtualized ENvironment for Uav Emulation


_Key words: UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), Network Emulator_

This repository provides a Virtual Machine (VM) that incorporates the VENUE (Virtualized ENvironment for UAV Network Emulation) emulator installation. It also contains a tutorial to carry out a simple experiment. With this knowledge, researchers should be able to proceed with more sophisticated analyses. However, for any question or doubt about the VM, please contact me at victor.sanchez@imdea.org

This work is based on [Linux Containers](https://linuxcontainers.org/) and [Ns3](https://www.nsnam.org/), more specifically in [HOWTO Use Linux Containers to set up virtual networks](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/HOWTO_Use_Linux_Containers_to_set_up_virtual_networks) tutorial from the ns3 wiki.

Implementation details and motivating scenarios for using this tool can be found in the following article: [VENUE article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8880644)
